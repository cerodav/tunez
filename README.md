Tunez

Basically its song downloader, which uses almost every resource from mp3skull.cr, but also provides additional features 
not available in mp3skull like :
1. Sorting based on Quality , Duration and Size
2. Better Interface
3. Album Art selection

Currently under developement, 
fix required for :
1. Additional features to be added on the home page
2. mutagen finds it difficult to encode certain music files
3. Automatic integration of music file and the selected album art

Thank You :)
